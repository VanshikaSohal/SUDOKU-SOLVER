# 🔢 Sudoku Solver using Arrays

This project is a **Sudoku Solver** that takes an incomplete 9x9 Sudoku board and fills it with a valid solution using **arrays** and **backtracking**. It is a classic application of recursion, 2D arrays, and constraint satisfaction.

## 💡 Concept

🔹 Sudoku is a 9x9 grid where each row, column, and 3x3 box must contain digits from 1 to 9 without repetition  
🔹 A backtracking algorithm tries digits from 1 to 9 in empty cells and recursively fills the board  
🔹 If a digit causes a conflict, the algorithm backtracks and tries the next possible value

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

🔹 C++ 
🔹 2D Arrays  
🔹 Backtracking and Recursion  
🔹 Console Output

---

## ✨ Features

🔹 Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle  
🔹 Uses arrays for board representation  
🔹 Clean and readable code with step-by-step logic  
🔹 Fast solving time using backtracking optimization

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile (for C++):
   ```bash
   g++ sudoku.cpp -o solver
   ./solver
